# Course Search
I am proud of my computer science project, Course Search, which categorizes and explains courses to simplify class selection. It provides an efficient alternative to traditional catalogs, aiming to help students make informed decisions about their academic paths. This well-organized tool is designed to contribute to students' academic success and satisfaction. By offering a platform for course exploration, it minimizes the time spent navigating through catalogs, especially benefiting those uncertain about their academic choices. Ultimately, Course Search provides students with a convenient and accessible tool to explore course options and make more informed decisions, fostering a more efficient academic experience.
