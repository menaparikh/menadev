# Mena's Portfolio

Hi everyone! My name is Mena, and I'm an aspiring software developer.

I love computer science because it allows me to solve problems in an abstract way and create tools that are useful to other people. Computer science is a journey of exploration and discovery. I enjoy learning new things, and computer science allows me to do that. I enjoy the ability to create something new that is beneficial to the community. Computer science is also a great way to develop the skills necessary for success in any field. There are so many opportunities to use computer science to create success. I enjoy computer science because it allows me to try new things and learn from them.

I've been coding for the last 12 months, and I've worked on the projects below. To see more about what I've learned from each one and questions I still have, open the folders and see their respective README.md files for more. 

The URL for my project is [here](https://menaparikh.github.io/menadev/).
