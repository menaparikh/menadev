# Mena's Portfolio

Hi everyone! My name is Mena, and I'm an aspiring software developer.

I've been coding for the last 11 months, and I've worked on the projects below. To see more about what I've learned from each one and questions I still have, open the folders and see their respective README.md files for more. 

# Past Projects
Over the past 12 months, I have created:
* Tic-tac-toe
* A quiz game
* A paint app
* An alarm app
* Turtle Mini Projects (learning fundamentals)
* Course Search

These projects have each taught me new skills. Open up each project to see the skills I've learned for that project.

# Tools and Frameworks
Iâ€™ve learned to work with several frameworks since I started coding independently. My strongest language is currently OOP Python, and I also have exposure to React (for frontend tooling) and Flask.
