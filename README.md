# Mena's Portfolio

Hi everyone! My name is Mena, and I'm an aspiring software developer.

I've been coding for the last 11 months, and I've worked on the projects below. To see more about what I've learned from each one and questions I still have, open the folders and see their respective README.md files for more. 

# Past Projects
Over the past 12 months, I have created:
* Tic-tac-toe
* A quiz game
* A paint app
* An alarm app
