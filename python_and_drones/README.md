# Python and Drones
These projects were made in a week-long Drone and Code camp. At this camp I had the ability to leanr new things about python and also was able to code cool projects. I learned a lot from this camp and so I'm exited to share it with you.

# Controller
In this project, I studied if statements. I learned about if, elif, and else. In this project, the drone will take off and it will ask you if you want the drone to fly forward, backward, left, or right. After the drone completes its first task, it will ask you what shape it should draw. I liked this project because I liked leanred about using xyz coordinates to create curves.

# Drone Movements
In this project, I learned about how to make the drone trace shapes in Python. I learned about loops and the basic callibrating commands. For this project. all you really need to do it run it. The drone we take off, and then trace out a triangle, square, pentagon, and lastly an octogon. I liked this project because I learned how the drone moves and spins.

# LED
In this project, I learned how to code an attachable light box. I got to practice my skills when using if statements and learning about the light box. For this project, it will ask you what color you want the top light of the box to be. Then the color will change. I liked experimenting with the light box and it was cool learning about it.

# Mission Pad
In this project, I learned about the drone's sensors and how they react. I learned about while true loops, modulo, and switch. For this project, there is a designated saquare that the rone stays in. The mission pad gets placed anywhere in the circle, and within a couple of seconds, the drone will find it and land on it. I liked learning about the sensors and the mission pads.

# Name game
In this project, I learned about if statements as well, but it was the very beginning of the week, and I needed to re-learn what they were. What you do is you type in one of my classmates name or my name and you get a fun fact about them. I liked this project because not only did it help me learn a little bit about each classmate but it also gave me a refresher on Python.

# Person Class
This project is the same as the name game, but I used a different method to create it. I learned about classes and how to incorporate them into the code.

# Sensing Mission Pad (sensingmp.py)
This projects taught me what mission pads are and how the drone senses them. I learned about how to change the picture displayed on the light box. What happens is the drone takes off and then it senses objects beneath it. If the object(such as your hand) is close enough, then it will display a happy face, but if there is nothing near it, then it displays a sad face.
