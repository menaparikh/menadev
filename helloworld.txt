1. When we make any changes, we can see the status immediately using `git status`. 
2. When we want to add a new file, we can do so using `git add <filename>`.
3. To make sure our changes are saved, we do `git commit -m "commit message to explain what changed"`
4. To finalize changes, we do `git push`. 

If you have any files you want to remove, you can remove them from the folder itself on your local machine, and then do the same process.
